                <h2>A little bit of this...<br>...and little bit of that</h2>
                <h3>Welcome to My World!</h3>
                <p>
                    Hey there! As you can probably figure out by now that my name is Kevin Tran. I am Vietnamese American. Born on January 10th, 1994 and have always
                    lived in Minnesota my whole life. I have one older brother who is a Nursing Assistant working on becoming a Registered Nurse (RN). On my spare time I enjoy 
                    working out and exercising. Other interests and hobbies include playing video games, anything car related (JDM) and sometimes just to ease my mind just watching
                    whatever I need to catch up on, on Youtube. Whether that be car vlogs, podcasts, lifestyle vlogs, etc. just something that I can just be "free". I have been employed 
                    at my currrent job--Resideo for 10 years. Where I am currently a Manufacturing Supervisor. I first started there as a temp-worker that got hired on as regular assembly
                    worker then eventually made my way to a Group Leader after 4 years. Did Group Leading for 5 years and just recently got promoted to the next Leadership position as Supervisor
                    and hoping to continue this position until what the future has in place for me. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What led me in to persuing Software Engineering is that I finally built up the courage to start something that I've wanted to do years ago. What stopped me from attempting was
                    because I was content with my current job back then and thought that that was all I needed. But that all changed when reality kicked in and I wanted more for my 
                    future. I evaluated and analyzed the possibiilties and opportunities that Software Engineering can bring to me in the future and without a doubt then I decided to 
                    sign up for a bootcamp and start the cohort. Becoming a Software Engineer is massive stepping stone into my goals of the future, because it will allow me to potentially
                    work remotely and offer competitive pay and the progression in pay is immensely greater than my current career path. Through my dedication and motivation I am sure that 
                    I will succeed in this cohort and gradually and exponentially grow as a Software Engineer through my strong skills of critical thinking, troubleshooting and working smarter not harder.
